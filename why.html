				<h1 class="getting_started_head">Why?</h1>
				<div class="normal_text answer">Spark's intention is not to compete with Sinatra, or the dozen of clones in different languages (Grafitti, Nancy, Flask, Sammy etc...). Its intention is to be used by Java developers that want or are required to develop in pure Java.
<br><br>
Spark focuses on being as simple and straight-forward as possible, without the need for cumbersome (XML) configuration, to enable very fast web application development in pure Java with minimal effort. (It’s a totally different paradigm when compared to the overuse of annotations for accomplishing pretty trivial stuff seen in JAX-RS).</div>
				<!--<div class="normal_text"><b>Why not use Sinatra?</b></div>
				<div class="normal_text answer">If you're an experienced Ruby developer or in languages with similar syntax you should definitely
				use Sinatra. However, if you're a Java developer and want to get the benefits you get from Sinatra
				but you don't want or have the time (money) to learn a new language, Spark is a really good alternative!</div>
				<br/>
				<div class="normal_text"><b>Why not go with JAX-RS?</b></div>
				<div class="normal_text answer">JAX-RS is a nice API that made life easier for Java web developers when it arrived. 
				However, it's a bit messy due to the overuse of annotations for accomplishing pretty trivial things.
				The annotation magic also makes things more implicit and it's not as easy to get a fast understanding on things as
				you get when looking at code using Spark. For a newbie in web frameworks and REST Spark will
				have you up and running a bit faster than using one of the JAX-RS implementations.</div>
				<div class="normal_text"><h2></h2></div>
				<div class="normal_text"><b>Okey, so why use Spark?</b></div>
				<div class="normal_text answer">Again, if you're a Java developer with neither the urge or time to learn a new
				programming language and are not planning to build a super large web application that scales in all directions,
				then Spark is a great alternative. It will have you up and running in notime without having
				to think about configuration and other cumbersome activities.</div> -->
